	I want to thank Riley Shahar who helped me prove a lot of results and without whom I would not have completed this project. I also want to thank Michael Sarris for sparking my interest in Computer Science. Finally, I would like to thank Charlie McGuffey, who has been the best thesis advisor I could ask for and has helped make this into an actual thesis. I would also like to thank my family, Olivia, and others who have helped get me here today.

    \chapter*{Abstract}
	One of the ways we seek to improve a computer's overall performance is through Caching. Caching uses levels of memory that are smaller and faster than main memory, allowing data to be retrieved more time-efficiently. To decide what data is stored in these caches, caching algorithms were created. One way to test these algorithms' performance is by generating miss ratio curves (MRC). These curves show how different cache sizes affect the performance of an algorithm on a trace of items. This MRC generation requires lots of computational work, requiring the algorithm to be tested on every cache size. There is a way around this work, which is through the use of Mattson's algorithm. This algorithm is currently limited to the paging model. We expand efficient MRC creation to the cost model. Our work relies on a new algorithm called Sum Cost Priority (SCP). We show that this algorithm performs within $\pm$5\% of an algorithm with proven theoretical properties on $62.3\%$ of generated traces and 82.1\% of traces from Twitter.

    Caches will only become more useful as the amount of data available to computers increases over time. Up until this work, the efficient generation of MRCs was limited to the paging model and did not have a wide use case because of this limitation. This thesis introduced Sum Cost Priority (SCP), which allows for the expansion of efficient generations of MRCs to factor in cost instead of just the paging model. SCP currently has unknown theoretical performance, but the empirical results on traces when compared to Landlord are promising. We believe that this expansion of efficient MRC generation will allow more research to occur in the cost model. We also believe that it will help efficient MRC generation be expanded and generalized to more models of caching. Further research can still be done with SCP such as proving its upper competitive bound.
